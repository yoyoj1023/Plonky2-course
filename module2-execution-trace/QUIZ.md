# üìä Quiz Solutions

## Part 1: Multiple Choice Answers

### 1. Answer: B
**Explanation:** Execution trace is a two-dimensional table structure where each row represents a time step (state) in the computation process, and each column represents a variable, register, or computation result. This structure clearly shows the temporality and state evolution of computation.

### 2. Answer: B
**Explanation:** Transition constraints describe state change relationships between adjacent rows (time steps), i.e., `state[i+1] = f(state[i])`. They ensure each computation step follows correct state transition rules.

### 3. Answer: A
**Explanation:** According to Fibonacci transition rules:
- `a[i+1] = b[i]` ‚Üí `a = 3`
- `b[i+1] = c[i]` ‚Üí `b = 5` 
- `c[i+1] = a[i+1] + b[i+1]` ‚Üí `c = 3 + 5 = 8`

### 4. Answer: B  
**Explanation:** Plonky2's innovation lies in maintaining PLONK's underlying architecture (gate constraints and copy constraints) while using this mechanism to efficiently implement AIR-style structured constraints, combining advantages of both.

### 5. Answer: C
**Explanation:** AIR constraints have highly structured characteristics, usually only involving relationships between adjacent rows, making them particularly suitable for describing repetitive, regular computation processes like virtual machine execution.

## Part 2: Short Answer Solutions

### 6. PLONK and AIR Arithmetization Thinking Differences (12 points)

**a) Thinking Mode (4 points)**
- **PLONK**: Circuit graph thinking, represents computation as connection graphs of gates and wires, focuses on logical relationships
- **AIR**: Time series thinking, represents computation as state evolution process on timeline

**b) Constraint Source (4 points)**  
- **PLONK**: Constraints come from gate logical relationships, each gate defines mathematical relationships between inputs and outputs
- **AIR**: Constraints come from state transition rules, defining how system changes from one state to the next

**c) Application Scenarios (4 points)**
- **PLONK**: General computation, particularly suitable for scenarios requiring complex arbitrary connections
- **AIR**: Repetitive/regular computation, particularly suitable for structured scenarios like VM execution, cryptographic operations

### 7. Role of Boundary Constraints in AIR (12 points)

**a) What are Boundary Constraints (4 points)**
Boundary constraints are constraint conditions on specific rows in the execution trace (usually first or last row), defining the initial state and/or final state of computation.

**b) Why Boundary Constraints are Needed (4 points)**
- **Initialization**: Ensure computation starts from correct initial state
- **Result Verification**: Ensure computation achieves expected final result  
- **Completeness**: Work with transition constraints to completely define entire computation process

**c) Fibonacci Sequence Boundary Constraint Example (4 points)**
```
Initial boundary constraints:
- a[0] = 0  (F(0) = 0)
- b[0] = 1  (F(1) = 1)

Terminal boundary constraints (optional):
- c[n] = expected_result  (verify nth Fibonacci number)
```

### 8. Advantages of Plonky2 Hybrid Model (12 points)

**Mechanism of Copy Constraints Implementing Transition Constraints (6 points)**
- Plonky2 maps each row of execution trace to multiple PLONK variables
- Uses copy constraint `connect(trace[i].output, trace[i+1].input)` to implement state passing
- Converts AIR transition constraints into PLONKY copy constraints

**Benefits Brought (6 points)**
1. **Maintain Flexibility**: Can still use PLONK's arbitrary gate constraints
2. **Structured Efficiency**: AIR-level efficiency for repetitive computations
3. **Developer Friendly**: Can mix both constraint styles  
4. **Recursion Friendly**: Copy constraints are easier to handle in recursive verification

## Part 3: Application Solutions

### 9. Design x^8 Execution Trace (12 points)

**a) Trace Table Structure (4 points)**
```
| Step | base | result |
|------|------|--------|
|  0   |  x   |   x    |
|  1   |  x   |   x¬≤   |
|  2   |  x   |   x‚Å¥   |
|  3   |  x   |   x‚Å∏   |
```

**b) Transition Constraint Definitions (4 points)**
```
For each row i (i = 0, 1, 2):
result[i+1] = result[i] √ó result[i]
base[i+1] = base[i]  (base remains unchanged)
```

**c) Boundary Constraint Settings (4 points)**
```
Initial constraints:
- base[0] = x
- result[0] = x

Terminal constraints:
- result[3] = x^8
```

### 10. Plonky2 Hybrid Model Implementation (12 points)

**a) CircuitBuilder Main Steps (4 points)**
```rust
let mut builder = CircuitBuilder::new(config);

// Define input
let x = builder.add_virtual_target();

// Compute each power
let x_squared = builder.mul(x, x);           // x¬≤
let x_fourth = builder.mul(x_squared, x_squared);   // x‚Å¥  
let x_eighth = builder.mul(x_fourth, x_fourth);     // x‚Å∏
```

**b) Copy Constraint Connections (4 points)**
In this specific example, since each step is a squaring operation, copy constraints are implicit in the `mul` operations:
- Both inputs of `x_squared` connect to `x`
- Both inputs of `x_fourth` connect to `x_squared`  
- Both inputs of `x_eighth` connect to `x_fourth`

**c) Public Input and Private Witness Design (4 points)**
```rust
// Public inputs
builder.register_public_input(x);        // Input value x
builder.register_public_input(x_eighth); // Result x^8

// Private witness
let mut pw = PartialWitness::new();
pw.set_target(x, F::from_canonical_u64(input_value));

// Intermediate values x¬≤, x‚Å¥ are private, no external provision needed
```
