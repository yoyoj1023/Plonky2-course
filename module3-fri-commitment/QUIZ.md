# üìä Quiz Solutions

## Part 1: Multiple Choice Answers

### 1. Answer: C
**Explanation:** KZG requires trusted setup ("powers of tau" ceremony), which brings centralization risks. If the setup process is compromised or participants collude, the security of the entire system is threatened, contradicting blockchain's decentralization philosophy.

### 2. Answer: B
**Explanation:** FRI works through recursive "commit-fold-repeat" process: each folding round halves the polynomial degree, ultimately transforming a complex low-degree testing problem into simple checking of constant polynomials.

### 3. Answer: B  
**Explanation:** FRI folding is based on odd-even decomposition of polynomials. Any polynomial can be written as P(x) = P_even(x¬≤) + x¬∑P_odd(x¬≤), where P_even contains even terms and P_odd contains odd terms. This decomposition is the mathematical foundation enabling FRI to gradually reduce degree.

### 4. Answer: B
**Explanation:** FRI only relies on hash functions and field operations, while KZG requires elliptic curve pairings. When implementing in circuits, hash function constraint costs are far lower than pairing operations (~1000 vs 1,000,000+ constraints), giving FRI huge advantages in recursive verification.

### 5. Answer: C
**Explanation:** Plonky2's FRI configuration (28 query rounds, specific parameter settings) provides approximately 80 bits of security, which is sufficient for most applications while maintaining good performance balance.

## Part 2: Short Answer Solutions

### 6. FRI High-Level Working Principle (12 points)

**Commitment Phase (4 points)**
- Prover commits to polynomial P(x), claiming its degree ‚â§ d
- Use Merkle tree to commit all evaluations of polynomial on some domain

**Folding Phase (4 points)**  
- Verifier sends random challenge Œ±
- Prover computes folded polynomial: P_folded(y) = P_even(y) + Œ±¬∑P_odd(y)
- New polynomial's degree is approximately half of original

**Repeat Process (2 points)**
- Repeat folding process for k rounds until obtaining constant polynomial
- Each round halves degree: d ‚Üí d/2 ‚Üí d/4 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí constant

**Final Verification (2 points)**
- Perform simple check on constant polynomial
- Recursively verify consistency of all folding steps

### 7. FRI and KZG Performance Comparison (12 points)

**a) Proof Size (3 points)**
- **KZG**: Extremely small (~32 bytes), only needs one group element
- **FRI**: Medium (~45 KB), includes multiple rounds of Merkle paths and queries

**b) Verification Time (3 points)**
- **KZG**: Fast (~2ms), only needs one pairing operation
- **FRI**: Fast (~0.5ms), O(log d) hash operations

**c) Trusted Setup Requirements (3 points)**  
- **KZG**: Required, "powers of tau" ceremony
- **FRI**: Not required, completely transparent

**d) Recursion Friendliness (3 points)**
- **KZG**: Difficult, pairing implementation in circuits extremely expensive (~1M+ constraints)
- **FRI**: Easy, only needs hash and field operations (~100K constraints)

### 8. Analysis of Why FRI Suits Recursion (12 points)

**Circuit Implementation Cost Analysis (6 points)**
- **Elliptic curve pairing**: Requires complex elliptic curve operations, modular arithmetic, inversions, etc., enormous constraint count
- **Hash functions**: Poseidon hash designed for ZK-friendliness, only needs field addition and multiplication
- **Cost comparison**: FRI recursive verification constraint count is 10-100x less than KZG

**Mechanisms Supporting Efficient Recursion (6 points)**
1. **Field operation friendly**: FRI verification only needs basic Goldilocks field operations
2. **Avoid complex cryptography**: No need for elliptic curves, pairings, etc.
3. **Parallelization potential**: Hash verification can be highly parallelized
4. **Recursive composability**: Multiple FRI proofs easily aggregate into single proof

## Part 3: Computation Solutions

### 9. FRI Folding Calculation (12 points)

**Given:** P(x) = 2x¬≥ + 3x¬≤ + x + 4, Œ± = 7

**a) Odd-even decomposition (4 points)**
```
P_even(x¬≤) = 3x¬≤ + 4 = 3y + 4  (where y = x¬≤)
P_odd(x¬≤) = 2x¬≤ + 1 = 2y + 1   (extract coefficients of x)

Verification: P(x) = (3x¬≤ + 4) + x(2x¬≤ + 1) = 3x¬≤ + 4 + 2x¬≥ + x = 2x¬≥ + 3x¬≤ + x + 4 ‚úì
```

**b) Folding calculation (4 points)**
```
P_folded(y) = P_even(y) + Œ± ¬∑ P_odd(y)
            = (3y + 4) + 7 ¬∑ (2y + 1)
            = 3y + 4 + 14y + 7  
            = 17y + 11
```

**c) Degree verification (4 points)**
```
Original polynomial P(x) degree: 3
Folded P_folded(y) degree: 1

Degree reduction: 3 ‚Üí 1, conforms to FRI folding's degree halving principle
(In the context of variable substitution y = x¬≤, actual degree reduces from 3 to 1)
```
