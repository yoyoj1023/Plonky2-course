# üìä Quiz Solutions

## Part 1: Multiple Choice Answers

### 1. Answer: C
**Explanation:** For ultimate recursive performance, Plonky2 tightly couples components like Goldilocks field, Poseidon hash, and FRI together. While performance is excellent, it lacks flexibility and is difficult to adapt to different application requirements.

### 2. Answer: B
**Explanation:** Plonky3's core philosophy is modularity, deconstructing Plonky2's high-performance components into independent, pluggable modules, allowing developers to freely combine different fields, hash functions, commitment schemes, etc., based on application needs.

### 3. Answer: C
**Explanation:** Plonky3 supports free choice of multiple components: finite fields (Goldilocks, BN254, BLS12-381, etc.), hash functions (Poseidon, Keccak, Blake3, etc.), commitment schemes (FRI, KZG, IPA, etc.).

### 4. Answer: B
**Explanation:** Different modules of zkVMs have different optimal requirements: CPU modules suit high-performance fields, memory modules may need different fields to optimize specific operations, crypto modules need fields supporting specific elliptic curves. Modular design allows choosing optimal components for each part.
