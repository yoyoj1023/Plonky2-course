# üìä Quiz Solutions

## Part 1: Multiple Choice Answers

### 1. Answer: B
**Explanation:** The Goldilocks field prime is p = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1 = 18446744069414584321. This special form prime has excellent mathematical properties and hardware-friendly characteristics.

### 2. Answer: C
**Explanation:** The Goldilocks field's 2-adicity is 32, because p-1 = 2^64 - 2^32 = 2^32 √ó (2^32 - 1), with the maximum power of 2 being 2^32. This means FFTs up to 2^32 points can be performed.

### 3. Answer: B
**Explanation:** Called "Goldilocks" because this field's size and properties are just right: 64 bits matches modern CPUs, high 2-adicity supports large-scale FFT, modular arithmetic structure supports fast computation - embodying "perfect balance."

### 4. Answer: B  
**Explanation:** In zero-knowledge proof systems, all operations (polynomial operations, hash computations, constraint verification, FFT transforms, etc.) are performed in finite fields. Field operation efficiency directly determines entire system performance.

### 9. Goldilocks Field Operation Exercise (9 points)

**a) Calculate (2^63 + 100) mod p (3 points)**
```
x = 2^63 + 100
p = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1

Using fast modular arithmetic:
2^63 = 2^32 * 2^31
Since 2^64 ‚â° 2^32 - 1 (mod p)
So 2^63 ‚â° (2^32 - 1)/2 ‚â° 2^31 - 1/2

But more directly:
2^63 + 100 < 2^64, calculate directly
result = 9223372036854775808 + 100 = 9223372036854775908
```

**b) Efficiency Reasons (3 points)**
- Result is less than 2^64, no modular arithmetic needed
- Even if needed, only one fast reduction required
- Avoids expensive division operations
