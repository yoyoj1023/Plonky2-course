# üìä Quiz Solutions

## Part 1: Multiple Choice Answers

### 1. Answer: B
**Explanation:** PLONK's complete universal gate constraint includes five terms: linear terms q_L¬∑w_a, q_R¬∑w_b, q_O¬∑w_c, multiplication term q_M¬∑w_a¬∑w_b, and constant term q_C. The flexibility of this equation comes from being able to implement various logic gates by setting different q parameters.

### 2. Answer: B  
**Explanation:** Permutation arguments are PLONK's core innovation, used to implement copy constraints. They mathematically prove that variables at different positions in the circuit have the same value, which is crucial for connecting inputs and outputs of different gates.

### 3. Answer: C
**Explanation:** Plonky2's proof generation time is typically in seconds, not milliseconds. Milliseconds is the verification time. Plonky2's main goals are transparency (no trusted setup), efficient recursion, and hybrid arithmetization.

### 4. Answer: B
**Explanation:** PLONK is "circuit-centric" in design, providing extremely flexible gate constraints and arbitrary connections, like a free circuit board. This contrasts with AIR's "execution trace-centric" approach.

## Part 2: Short Answer Solutions

### 5. Mathematical Principle of Copy Constraints (15 points)

**Core Principle:** 
If two multisets A = {a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, ..., a‚Çô} and B = {b‚ÇÅ, b‚ÇÇ, ..., b‚Çô} are equal, then any of their symmetric polynomials are also equal.

**Mathematical Expression:**
```
For any Œ≤, Œ≥, if A = B, then:
‚àè·µ¢(Œ≤¬∑a·µ¢ + Œ≥) = ‚àè·µ¢(Œ≤¬∑b·µ¢ + Œ≥)
```

**Application in PLONK:**
- Original position set: {w(œÉ(1)), w(œÉ(2)), ..., w(œÉ(n))}
- Permuted set: {w(œÄ(1)), w(œÄ(2)), ..., w(œÄ(n))}
- Generate random challenges Œ≤, Œ≥ through Fiat-Shamir
- Prove equality of two polynomial products

**Scoring Criteria:**
- Correct understanding of polynomial properties of set equality (5 points)
- Correct mathematical formula (5 points)  
- Explanation of specific application in PLONK (5 points)

### 6. Three Design Motivations of Plonky2 (15 points)

**1. Eliminate Trusted Setup (5 points)**
- Problem: KZG commitments require "powers of tau" ceremony
- Risk: Centralization risk, if setup is compromised, entire system fails
- Solution: Adopt FRI commitment, completely transparent

**2. Achieve Efficient Recursion (5 points)**  
- Problem: Elliptic curve pairings extremely expensive to implement in circuits (~1M+ constraints)
- Limitation: Difficult to build recursive verification circuits
- Solution: FRI + Goldilocks field, recursive verification ~100K constraints

**3. Support Structured Computation (5 points)**
- Problem: PLONK's flexibility becomes a burden for repetitive, regular computations
- Scenario: zkEVM, zkVM requiring large amounts of repetitive instructions
- Solution: Hybrid model, use PLONK to implement AIR-style constraints

**Scoring Criteria:**
- Problem identification and solution for each motivation: 2.5 points each
- Clear logic and accurate expression

### 7. Gate Constraint Design Exercise (15 points)

**Goal:** `w_c = 3w_a¬≤ + 2w_b + 5`

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Decompose Computation**
- Need to compute `w_a¬≤` first
- Then compute linear combination

**Step 2: Gate Design**

**Gate 1 (Multiplication Gate):** Compute `w_a¬≤ ‚Üí temp`
```
q_L = 0, q_R = 0, q_O = -1, q_M = 1, q_C = 0
Constraint: w_a ¬∑ w_a - temp = 0
```

**Gate 2 (Linear Combination Gate):** Compute `3temp + 2w_b + 5 ‚Üí w_c`
```
q_L = 3, q_R = 2, q_O = -1, q_M = 0, q_C = 5  
Constraint: 3¬∑temp + 2¬∑w_b - w_c + 5 = 0
```

**Step 3: Copy Constraints**
- Connect Gate 1's output temp to Gate 2's first input

**Scoring Criteria:**
- Correctly identify need for 2 gates (3 points)
- Gate 1 parameter settings correct (4 points)
- Gate 2 parameter settings correct (4 points)

2. **Technical Match**: Repetitive instruction execution is Plonky2's hybrid model's advantage scenario
3. **Aggregation Capability**: Efficient recursion makes large-scale aggregation possible
4. **Acceptable Trade-off**: Increased proof size for complete transparency is worthwhile
