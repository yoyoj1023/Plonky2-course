## 📊 Quiz Score Analysis

### 🎯 Goal Setting
- **All quiz average ≥ 85**: Well prepared, ready to start actual projects
- **All quiz average ≥ 75**: Solid foundation, ready for in-depth research
- **All quiz average ≥ 70**: Meets passing standard, has basic capability

### 📈 Improvement Strategies
**If overall scores are low:**
1. **Re-learn weak modules**: Focus on modules with lowest scores
2. **Strengthen practice exercises**: Do more programming exercises, improve hands-on ability
3. **Deepen understanding of principles**: Don't settle for memorization, pursue deep understanding

**If certain question types are difficult:**
- **Many multiple choice errors**: Basic concepts not solid enough, need re-learning
- **Incomplete short answers**: Understanding not deep enough, need to think more about "why"
- **No idea on application questions**: Insufficient practical experience, need more practice
- **Confused logic in design questions**: Insufficient systematic thinking, need to learn architectural design
