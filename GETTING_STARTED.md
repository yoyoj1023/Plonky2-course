# üöÄ Plonky2 Course Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Plonky2 deep learning course! This guide will help you quickly begin your learning journey.

## ‚ö° 5-Minute Quick Experience

### 1. Run the Example
```bash
cd 133-Plonky2-course-v2/plonky2/plonky2
cargo run --example fibonacci_course
```

### 2. Observe the Output
You will see a complete zero-knowledge proof generation and verification process, including:
- Circuit construction
- Proof generation (about 1.2 seconds)  
- Proof verification (about 12 milliseconds)
- Proof of the 100th Fibonacci number

### 3. Understand the Significance
This simple example demonstrates Plonky2's core capabilities:
- **Succinctness**: 45KB fixed-size proof
- **Efficiency**: Second-level proof generation, millisecond-level verification
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Only proves computation correctness without revealing intermediate processes
