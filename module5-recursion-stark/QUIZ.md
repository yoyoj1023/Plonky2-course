# üìä Quiz Solutions

## Part 1: Multiple Choice Answers

### 1. Answer: B
**Explanation:** Recursive proof means a proof system can verify proofs it generates itself. This means you can build a circuit to verify the same type of proofs, enabling proof nesting and composition.

### 2. Answer: B
**Explanation:** Plonky2's recursive verification circuit requires approximately 100K constraints, which is a huge advantage compared to KZG-based systems (requiring 1M+ constraints to implement pairing operations).

### 3. Answer: B  
**Explanation:** Best practice is for STARKs to handle parallel generation of large amounts of standardized proofs (like transaction execution), while Plonky2 handles recursive aggregation of these proofs. This combines STARKs' high throughput with Plonky2's fast recursion advantages.

### 4. Answer: C
**Explanation:** The key advantage of proof aggregation is that regardless of how many proofs are aggregated, the final output proof size remains constant (~45KB), making on-chain verification costs fixed and amortizable across many transactions.
